So the Legend says, that this secret village was not always hidden, and some time ago it was a quite popular place. Some time ago, of course,
The GIANT SPIDERS was not a thing and people live their happy miserable lifes...
But once A King Vladimir decided that his territory is not big enough, even though it was literally the biggest territory that he could even regulate...
King Vladimir Putinkii The VII decided to declare war to the neighbouring Kingdom, but what he didn't know is that, the neighbouring kingdom was an ally
with the SPIDER QUEEN, and her thousands of blood craving giant killer-spiders...
Therefore King Vladimir Lost all what he had in an unequal battle.
Kids, please, be content with what you have and don't be greedy...
