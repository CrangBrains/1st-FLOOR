Right at the entrance to the tavern. You see an old man, who, for some reason, looks really familiar...
He almost immediately stands up and shouts: "No one can go past through GET OUT, BEFORE I SHOOT YOU!!!"
Damn it, he got a big gun... You wonder around a bit. Until you finally realise. The photo! He IS the guy form it!!
You calmly get up to the old guy with your hands raised, and give the photo to him...
"Where'd you get that young man... I... It's... Dear Lord...How?" - said the tavern keeper with a trembling voice.
You quickly tell him your story. And without any elaboration, he lets you in taking the photo of HIS family from you...

Ehem..Ehem... He also said that the password is 0909 (for .zip file)
