The dark knights can be a really big problem, their great armour and swords make them feel almost invincible! Fightinh them is a bad idea, most definetely.
So the way to the main gate is blocked. However you have another way of coming around, some say, that if you'll be able to go throughthe SpideR ForesT - you'll end up in a secret village,
and maybe the residents of that village can help with your problem 
***The Village can be found after the big Spider NEst


*** - in further adventures I'll refer to some minor problesms with "***" so yeah, pls first check the Spider Nest folder bro ;)
