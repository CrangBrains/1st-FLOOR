2nd floor is almost fully destroyed, you can see a hand that's peeking out of the rocks. Poor soul, got crashed under theese enormous rocks! In his hand you find a note :

"My Dear Bella, I beg of you keep my belonings away from the greedy goverment, you'll find my house in the Village on the 2nd floor of Devil'z quest. There right after you pass the spiders, which can be a daunting task, you'll find my dear village in the house with red roof, you will find my great ARMOUR OF ROTTED ORDER wich was made by the infamous rotten order to keep me safe at the shore of rotten lake, and a key, which you can use to open the chest that i hid on  the lonely island in the middle of the lake! Wish you the best of luck my dear, let the god keep you alive!!" ...
