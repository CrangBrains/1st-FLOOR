you see no end to the waters, but one suspicious pile of land can be barely seen right in the middle.
Everything dies there, not only the smell but the gas that is coming out of theese waters is completely obliterating you, to go there you need some real gear!
Some sort of armour and, who knows, maybe a key, for whatever lies there, on the piece of land...
